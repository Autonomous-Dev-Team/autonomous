# autonomous -- Creating a toolkit for RaspberryPI based robots
The goal is to create and continously enhance a robotics toolkit for educational purpose. Teach students to program classes
to control sensors, DC motors, LED's, stepper motors etc and to connect them.

It's all Open Source for education released under Apache2 license.

# What is it
The output is a single library that can be executed on a RaspberryPI board with Java 8

The library can be build in two ways:
* maven build -- mvn install from the root directory will produce the library in target
* copy the files on the RaspberryPI and step into the raspberrypi_cmd directory and run ./compile.sh


# Project Goals
1) Enable anybody interested to be able to create a low cost robot, self driving car and more
2) Learn the basics of Java programming in a fun environment
3) Build a powerfull toolset that we can share with others
4) Getting more people interested in programming
