# autonomous -- Creating a toolkit for RaspberryPI based robots
The goal is to create and continously enhance a robotics toolkit for educational purpose. Teach students to program classes
to control sensors, DC motors, LED's, stepper motors etc and to connect them.

It's all Open Source for education released under Apache2 license.

# Project pre-requisites
## Required components
PI4J libraries (http://pi4j.com)

PJ4J This project is intended to provide a friendly object-oriented I/O API and
implementation libraries for Java Programmers to access the full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform.
This project abstracts the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to focus on implementing their application business logic.

Java JDK 8 -- All samples and code is built and tested with Java 8

## Optional
maven -- Build and project management tool.



# Project Goals
1) Enable anybody interested to be able to create a low cost robot, self driving car and more
2) Learn the basics of Java programming in a fun environment
3) Build a powerfull toolset that we can share with others
4) Getting more people interested in programming
